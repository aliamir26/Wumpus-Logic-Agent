## 🎯 What Is This?

The **Wumpus World** is a classic AI problem from Russell & Norvig's *Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach*. A cave-exploring agent must navigate a grid containing a deadly Wumpus and bottomless Pits — armed with nothing but its senses and the power of **logical inference**.

This project implements a full **Knowledge-Based Agent (KBA)** that:

- Maintains a **Propositional Logic Knowledge Base (KB)**
- Uses **Resolution Refutation** (a complete inference algorithm) to prove cells are safe *before* moving into them
- Converts percept-based biconditional rules into **Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF)**
- Counts every resolution step performed — making the inference process transparent and educational

## 🧠 The Logic (How It Works)

### Propositional Variables

```
P_{r}_{c}    →  Pit at cell (row r, col c)
W_{r}_{c}    →  Wumpus at cell (row r, col c)
B_{r}_{c}    →  Breeze perceived at (r, c)
S_{r}_{c}    →  Stench perceived at (r, c)
V_{r}_{c}    →  Cell (r, c) has been visited
```

### Biconditional Rules (converted to CNF)

```
B_{r}_{c}  ↔  (P_{r-1,c} ∨ P_{r+1,c} ∨ P_{r,c-1} ∨ P_{r,c+1})
S_{r}_{c}  ↔  (W_{r-1,c} ∨ W_{r+1,c} ∨ W_{r,c-1} ∨ W_{r,c+1})
```

### Resolution Refutation

To prove cell (x,y) is safe, the agent asks the KB:

```
KB ⊨ ¬P_{x}_{y}  AND  KB ⊨ ¬W_{x}_{y}
```

This is done by negating the query, adding it to the KB, and attempting to derive the **empty clause (⊥)**. If derived → contradiction → query is **entailed**.

### Module Descriptions

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `resolution.py` | Core logic engine. CNF conversion, resolution rule, refutation loop, tautology checks |
| `knowledge_base.py` | KB class. `tell_percepts()` adds facts; `ask_safe()` queries via resolution |
| `agent.py` | `WumpusWorld` generates the hidden grid. `WumpusAgent` navigates using KB |
| `api.py` | REST endpoints: `/new_game`, `/move`, `/ai_step`, `/ai_solve`, `/reveal` |
| `main.py` | FastAPI app setup, static files, templates, CORS middleware |
| `index.html` | Full frontend: grid rendering, percept display, metrics dashboard, game over overlay |
| `styles.css` | Dark theme variables, animated cell states, glassmorphism panels |

## 🛠 Run Locally

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- pip

### Steps

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/aliamir26/wumpus-logic-agent.git
cd wumpus-logic-agent

# 2. Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate        # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Run the server
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000

# 5. Open in browser
# → http://localhost:8000
```

## 🚀 Deployment on Vercel

Vercel supports Python via Serverless Functions. Here's how to deploy:

### Step 1 — Install Vercel CLI

```bash
npm install -g vercel
```

### Step 2 — Login

```bash
vercel login
```

### Step 3 — Deploy

```bash
cd wumpus-logic-agent
vercel
```

Follow the prompts:
- **Set up and deploy?** → Yes
- **Which scope?** → Your account
- **Link to existing project?** → No (create new)
- **Project name?** → wumpus-logic-agent
- **In which directory is your code?** → ./

### Step 4 — Set Python version (optional)

Create `.python-version` file:
```
3.11
```

### Step 5 — Redeploy for production

```bash
vercel --prod
```

Your app will be live at `https://wumpus-logic-agent-zeta.vercel.app/` 🎉

> **Note:** The in-memory game state resets between serverless function invocations on Vercel. For persistent sessions, add a Redis backend (e.g., Upstash Redis) and store game state there.

## 🎮 How to Play

1. **Select grid size** (4×4 Easy → 8×8 Hard)
2. **Set pit density** (5% to 25%)
3. Press **⚡ Start New Game**
4. In **Manual Mode**: Use arrow keys or the D-Pad, or **click adjacent cells** to move
5. In **AI Mode**: Press **▶ AI Step** for one inference step, or **⚡ Auto-Solve** to watch the agent reason through the grid
6. Watch the **inference steps counter** climb as the agent proves cells safe via Resolution Refutation
7. If the agent dies, the **world is revealed** — see exactly where the Wumpus and Pits were hiding

## 🔬 Challenges & Learning Outcomes

### Challenge 1: CNF Conversion of Biconditionals

Biconditionals `B ↔ (P₁ ∨ P₂ ∨ … ∨ Pₙ)` must be split into:
- One forward clause: `{¬B, P₁, P₂, …, Pₙ}`
- N backward clauses: `{¬Pᵢ, B}` for each i

Getting this right — especially handling tautologies and duplicates — was the trickiest part.

### Challenge 2: Resolution Loop Termination

The resolution loop can generate exponentially many clauses. A safety cap (2000 clauses) was added to prevent infinite loops while keeping the engine educational and debuggable.

### Challenge 3: Agent Navigation Without Global Knowledge

The agent must decide where to move using only what it has sensed so far. BFS-based pathfinding through proven-safe cells was layered on top of the KB to handle backtracking.

### Learning Outcomes

- Deep understanding of Resolution Refutation as a complete inference procedure
- CNF conversion for compound propositional sentences
- Designing a Knowledge Base with `tell/ask` abstraction
- Building a reactive, KB-driven agent architecture
- FastAPI + Jinja2 + Tailwind for full-stack Python web apps
